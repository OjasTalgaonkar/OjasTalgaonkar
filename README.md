Hi &#127754; , My name is Ojas Talgaonkar, I'm from the US but ethnically Indian. My goal with Coding is to create projects that I think are cool or fun. 

I am proficient in Java, Python, JavaScript and C. 
I am currently working on Web Development.

My goals for 2024 are to
- Learn a Javascript Frontend Framework (Preferably React or Vue)
- Get familiar with Database programs like Mongo and SQL
- Start creating Machine Learning Projects
- Learn GO lang


Aside from Programming, i have interest in art and music.
- I have been practicing Traditional sketch art and digital art for years &#x1F58C;

- I prefer animation over live action media

I also like listening to music whenever i do anything. Heres my <a href="[https://www.example.com](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1BM6EG9ExE7aoNWsJcsO4O?si=aea4d2e172ed4f49)https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1BM6EG9ExE7aoNWsJcsO4O?si=aea4d2e172ed4f49">playlist</a> if you're interested
